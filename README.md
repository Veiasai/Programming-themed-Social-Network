# Social Network of Programming

## A social-oriented instead of tech-oriented platform
Unlike stackoverflow,ruby-china and many other platforms enabling programmers to seek for help or help others, this programming-themed platform aims at providing a better social contact for both programmers and laymen. It is a platform similar to Weibo and Twitter but programming-themed. You can post anything about programming on this platform.
